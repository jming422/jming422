Hi, I'm Jonathan. I'm a curious, consciencious, and sometimes silly software engineer. I cut my teeth writing programs that made ASCII art greeting cards as gifts for my mom, and I've been building software ever since. Today, I lead [Reveel](https://reveelgroup.com/)'s web application team, and occasionally find time to work on these projects of my own:

- [Dataslab](https://codeberg.org/jming422/dataslab) (Codeberg) -- Digital character sheet for tabletop role-playing game Stars Without Number (Elm + TypeScript)
- [ydnc-time](https://codeberg.org/jming422/ydnc-time) (Codeberg) -- Bluetooth-controlled time tracking terminal app (Rust)
- [bikeputer](https://git.sr.ht/~jming422/bikeputer) (sourcehut) -- Custom UI for my stationary exercise bike, with automatic timer & speed monitor (Rust)
- [sms-emu](https://github.com/artenator/sms-emu) (GitHub, work-in-progress with [@artenator](https://github.com/artenator)) -- SEGA Master System emulator (Rust)
